Collection of public presentations that I gave during my PhD and postdoctoral studies in Particle Physics.

The presentations are written using the [Beamer LaTeX class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)). In each presentation folder, the pdf of the presentation can be produced by unzipping `figs.zip` and running `make`.
For producing the pdf, you need a distribution for the TeX typesetting system, such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html).
