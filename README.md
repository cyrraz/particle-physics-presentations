Collection of public presentations that I gave during my PhD and postdoctoral studies in Particle Physics.

The presentations are written using the [Beamer LaTeX class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)). In each presentation folder, the pdf of the presentation can be produced by unzipping `figs.zip` and running `make`.
